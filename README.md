# QuickCPUTest

run "pip install psutil matplotlib" to install the packages matplotlib and psutil. You can just do git clone to clone this whole thing! Also, V2 is the best so far, I put V1 in there just so you guys can see how it used to be before I really locked in and got to work.

I wanted to do a really quick CPU test, using CLI, so I decided to do just that! I made my own little python tester, and you have to run "pip install psutil matplotlib" in the terminal before running this scrip, it makes it's own folders, look, it'll be there somewhere!
